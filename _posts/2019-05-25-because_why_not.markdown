Jeff Bezos uses the Regret Minimization Framework to simplify difficult decisions. It starts by asking: In X years, will I regret not doing this? If yes, do it.

In 20 years, will I regret speding my free time studying/coding/debugging when I could've sit on the couch browing through Netflix? Probably not.

Will I regret not getting back into coding and wonder where I could've been? More than likely.

So here I am. :)
